# Top Free Websites to Deploy Your Code

Deploying your code is a vital step in software development. Whether you’re showcasing a portfolio project, testing a prototype, or deploying a full-fledged application, free deployment platforms provide excellent solutions. Here, we’ll explore three top-tier platforms—**GitHub Pages**, **Vercel**, and **Heroku**—and discuss their features, use cases, and how to get started.

## 1. **GitHub Pages**

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service for static websites, directly integrated with GitHub repositories. It's an excellent choice for personal projects, portfolios, and documentation.

### Features:
- **Static Site Hosting:** Ideal for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based sites.
- **Free SSL Certificates:** Ensures your site is secure.
- **Custom Domains:** Support for custom domain names with easy setup.
- **Version Control Integration:** Automatically updates your site whenever you push changes to the repository.

### Use Cases:
- Personal portfolios or resumes.
- Documentation for projects or APIs.
- Static sites for events or small businesses.

### How to Deploy:
1. **Create a GitHub Repository:** Add your website files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to a new repository.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to the repository’s settings.
   - Under the "Pages" section, select the branch and directory containing your site files.
3. **Access Your Site:** Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.

### Pros:
- Simple and straightforward setup.
- Fully free with no hidden costs.
- Version control ensures smooth updates and rollback options.

### Cons:
- Limited to static sites (no server-side functionality).
- Requires familiarity with Git and GitHub.

## 2. **Vercel**

Vercel is a versatile platform designed for deploying modern web applications, including static sites and serverless functions. It's especially popular in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### Features:
- **Automatic Deployment:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for continuous deployment.
- **Serverless Functions:** Supports backend logic with serverless functions.
- **Global CDN:** Ensures fast loading times with globally distributed servers.
- **Custom Domains:** Free SSL certificates for custom domains.
- **Preview Deployments:** Creates previews for every pull request.

### Use Cases:
- Deploying React, Next.js, or Vue.js applications.
- Prototyping web applications with serverless backend functionality.
- Hosting dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).

### How to Deploy:
1. **Sign Up:** Create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. **Connect a Repository:** Link your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
3. **Configure the Project:**
   - Vercel auto-detects frameworks (like Next.js).
   - Set up build commands if necessary (e.g., `npm run build`).
4. **Deploy:** Push changes to your repository, and Vercel will automatically deploy your site.

### Pros:
- Excellent for modern JavaScript frameworks.
- Serverless functionality expands possibilities beyond static sites.
- Intuitive dashboard for managing projects and domains.

### Cons:
- Limited monthly build and bandwidth allowances on the free plan.
- Steeper learning curve for beginners unfamiliar with serverless architecture.

## 3. **Heroku**

Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications. While it’s versatile and beginner-friendly, its free tier is particularly well-suited for small applications and prototypes.

### Features:
- **Supports Multiple Languages:** Deploy applications in Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Java, and more.
- **Simple Deployment:** Push code to Heroku using Git for automatic deployment.
- **Add-ons Marketplace:** Enhance functionality with add-ons like databases, monitoring tools, and caching.
- **Dyno Scaling:** Start with a free dyno (virtual server instance) and scale up as needed.

### Use Cases:
- Deploying backend applications with APIs.
- Prototyping full-stack web apps.
- Hosting small-scale projects requiring databases or dynamic content.

### How to Deploy:
1. **Sign Up:** Create an account at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
2. **Install the Heroku CLI:** Download and install the command-line interface for easier interaction.
3. **Create a Heroku App:** Run `heroku create` in your terminal to set up a new application.
4. **Push Your Code:** Use `git push heroku main` to deploy your application.
5. **Access Your Site:** Your app will be live at `https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com`.

### Pros:
- Wide language support for backend and full-stack projects.
- Free database hosting with PostgreSQL add-on.
- Scales easily with growing project demands.

### Cons:
- Free tier apps "sleep" after inactivity, leading to slower initial load times.
- Limited free tier resources (550–1,000 dyno hours per month).
